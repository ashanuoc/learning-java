# Java Learning Journey

This repository contains my Java practice projects and exercises as I progress through [Jenny's Lectures - Java course](https://www.jennyslectures.com/) on her lecture website. Organized into folders for assignments, coding challenges, and interview preparation, each section explores different Java concepts and skills, helping me track my progress and experiment with new ideas.

## Learning Goals
- Build a strong foundation in Java syntax and object-oriented programming.
- Practice algorithms and data structures.
- Improve coding skills for technical interviews.

## Resources
- [Jenny's Lectures - Java Course](https://www.jennyslectures.com/) â€“ My primary resource for learning Java.
